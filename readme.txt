This program is another practice program.

This program is fairly simple. It is a practice with $_GET requests to other servers.

User inputs name of anime into first form along with the amount of episodes that are available on hosting site.

Program creates a local file called whatever the user inputted replacing spaces with dashes. Fills it with the get request
necessary for the second host server.

Second form then takes the name of the anime the user inputs. (if available) it is openned and read. Then shows to the user the links of all the html requests in the file.
